This geoprocess can work with many input layers. It merges all of these creating a new result layer
which has a feature for each feature of all input layers.

Because each input layer could have its own alphanumeric schema, user must select which layer will preserve
its schema. The rest of input layers will only preserve those attributes whose name and type would be the same that
an attribute of the input layer whose schema will be preserved.
