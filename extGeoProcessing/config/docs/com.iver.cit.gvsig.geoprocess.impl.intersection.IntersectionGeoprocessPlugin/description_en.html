This geoprocess works with two layers: the input layer and the overlay layer.
</P>
<P>
For each geometry in the input layer, it computes its intersections with the geometries of
the overlay layer. For each intersection, it adds a new feature with the intersection as geometry
and all attributes of the features which originates it.

It is called "Spatial AND", because features of the result layer models a space common to both layers.
