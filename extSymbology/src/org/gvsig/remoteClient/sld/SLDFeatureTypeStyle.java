/**
 * Implements the FeatureTypeStyle element of an SLD implementation specification 
 * .<p>
 * The FeatureTypeStyle defines the styling that is to be applied to a single feature
 * type of a layer. This element may also be externally re-used outside of the WMSes
 * and layers.<p>
 * 
 * The FeatureTypeStyle element identifies that explicit separation between the
 * handling of features of specific feature types. The 'layer' concept is unique 
 * to WMS and SLD, but features are used more generally, such as in WFS and GML,
 * so this explicit separation is important.<p>
 * 
 * Like a UserStyle, a FeatureTypeStyle can have a Name, Title, and Abstract.
 * The Name element does not have an explicit use at present, though it conceivably
 * might be used to reference a feature style in some feature-style library. The Title
 * and Abstract are for human-readable information.<p>
 * 
 * The FeatureTypeName identifies the specific feature type that the feature-type 
 * style is for. It is allowed to be optional, but only if one feature type is 
 * in-context (in-layer) and that feature type must match the syntax and semantics 
 * of all feature-property references inside of the FeatureTypeStyle. Note that 
 * there is no restriction against a single UserStyle from including multiple 
 * FeatureTypeStyles that reference the same FeatureTypeName. This case does not 
 * create an exception in the rendering semantics,however, since a map styler is 
 * expected to process all FeatureTypeStyles in the order that they appear, 
 * regardless, plotting one instance over top of another.<p>
 * 
 * The SemanticTypeIdentifier is experimental and is intended to be used to identify
 * what the feature style is suitable to be used for using community-controlled 
 * name(s). For example, a single style may be suitable to use with many different
 * feature types. The syntax of the SemanticTypeIdentifier string is undefined, but
 * the strings �generic:line�, �generic:polygon�, �generic:point�, �generic:text�,
 * �generic:raster�, and �generic:any� are reserved to indicate that a FeatureTypeStyle
 * may be used with any feature type with the corresponding default geometry type
 * (i.e., no feature properties are referenced in the feature-type style).<p>
 * 
 * The FeatureTypeStyle contains one or more Rule elements that allow conditional
 * rendering. Rules are discussed in Section 10.
