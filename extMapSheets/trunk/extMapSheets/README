Introduction
============

This document covers the description of:

* Version information.

* Build instructions.

* Packaging instructions.

* Internationalization notes.


Version information
===================

The policy carried out in order to increment the version number is the same as gvSIG but taking into account the following:

- Changes to the micro number only must be both forward- and backward-compatible.

- Changes to the minor number must be backward-compatible.

- Changes to the major number indicates that the version can not be forward- and backward-compatible.

The version number is specified in the file "install/intall.xml" 
in the tag: <appversion>0.1.0</appVersion> and in the file imstall/build.properties.

It should also be changed in the file "config/about.htm" in tag:
<b>Version 0.1.0</b> 


Build instructions
===============================

The code is compatible with the 1.5 JVM. 

Setting up a workspace to version 1.12 of gvSIG and then include this project into that workspace.

To build it from the workspace can be launched build.xml to generate the necessary packaging within _fwAndami.


Packaging instructions
=============================== 

To build an package installer with this plugin, do this:

- Make sure that the file package.info is correctly updated (names, version number, build number, etc)
- Run the 'generate-without-source' target in build.xml so that all the binaries are copied to _fwAndami
- Start gvSIG in your workspace and use the org.gvsig.installer.app.extension extension to generate
package file and index file.
- Make those files available to final users and/or plugin repository administrators (more info
about the plugin manager:

Internationalization notes
===================================

* Where you can find the translation strings. 

Translation strings are inside the files "text_*.properties", where * is the ISO 639-1 language code, 
in the "config". The languages that are currently translated are:

+------------+--------------------+
| *Language* | *ISO 639-1 code*   |
+------------+--------------------+
| Spanish    | es		          |
+------------+--------------------+
| English    | en	              |
+------------+--------------------+

* What should I do to include a new language

To add a new language, create a file, with the keys of one that already exists, with the language name 
followed by an underscore and the ISO 639-1 language code followed by the extension ".properties" 

Ex: For Galician: "text_gl.properties"

You can get the list of ISO 639-1 codes on the following link: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1

Public access to package tools
==============================

The tools you need to package this extension are available in the gvSIG main SVN repo:

https://svn.forge.osor.eu/svn/gvsig-desktop
Folder: trunk/install

Download the "install" folder as a new folder in your Eclipse workspace.
